# Development Process Codes

## DPC101:
    The print statement used here is maybe invalid as the compiler
    should be launched from anywhere, verify its validity later.


## DPC102:
    Note that file loading error catching can't print anything to the user,
    instead, the invalidity of the file is confirmed by the returned None.

## DPC103:
    After the Logging system implementation, adds an internal compiler warning
    for duplicates or/and implement a file_version system.

## DPC104:
    A path/file existence verifier potentially needs to be added later.
    Add a sys.exit(1) with internal error if data not found.
