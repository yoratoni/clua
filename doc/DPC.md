# Development Process Codes

## DPC101:
    The print statement used here is maybe invalid as the compiler
    should be launched from anywhere, verify its validity later.


## DPC102:
    Loading all the user project config files is not the best idea
    ever, try to load them when the compiler walks inside the directory,
    maybe by trying to re-run the default part every time it enters a new directory.
    

## DPC103:
    Logging & sys.exit(1) are necessary for this main static method, thinks about adding them.
